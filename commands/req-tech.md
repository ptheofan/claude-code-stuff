Have architect-reviewer and typescript-pro evaluate technical feasibility:

Technical analysis:
- Architecture implications and design patterns
- Technology stack recommendations
- Database design considerations
- API design and integration requirements
- Security and compliance implications
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Testing strategy and complexity

Development policy alignment:
- TypeScript implementation approach
- Dependency management and build order
- Testing coverage strategy (unit vs integration)
- Error handling architecture
- Code quality and maintainability factors

Risk assessment:
- Technical complexity estimation
- Potential integration challenges
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Maintenance and scalability concerns

Recommendations:
- Preferred implementation approach
- Technology and framework choices
- Development phases and milestones
- Risk mitigation strategies

Requirements for technical analysis: $ARGUMENTS
