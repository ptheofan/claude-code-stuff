Have product-manager and technical-writer work together to refine these requirements:

Enhancement areas:
- Convert high-level requirements into detailed user stories
- Add specific acceptance criteria for each story
- Define data models and interfaces (TypeScript-ready)
- Specify error conditions and handling
- Add non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- Include API specifications where relevant
- Define testing scenarios and edge cases

Apply our development standards:
- Ensure requirements support KISS principle
- Plan for 80%+ test coverage
- Consider dependency-aware build order
- Include proper error handling specifications
- Avoid deprecated technologies or patterns

Output format:
- Refined user stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications and data models
- Testing requirements and scenarios
- Build order recommendations
