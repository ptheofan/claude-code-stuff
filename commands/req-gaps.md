Have business-analyst specifically focus on comprehensive gap analysis for these requirements:

- Business rules and constraints
- User personas and detailed use cases
- Integration requirements and external dependencies
- Data requirements (storage, validation, migration)
- Compliance and regulatory needs
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Error handling and edge cases
- Authentication and authorization needs
- API requirements and third-party integrations
- Deployment and infrastructure considerations

Prioritize gaps by:
- Impact on MVP functionality
- Dependencies (foundational vs dependent features)
- Risk level if left unaddressed
