argument-hint: [requirements-text]
---

Have multi-agent-coordinator orchestrate a comprehensive business requirements analysis using:

1. business-analyst: Analyze current requirements for completeness, clarity, and feasibility
2. product-manager: Evaluate business value, priority, and scope alignment  
3. ux-researcher: Identify user experience gaps and usability considerations
4. legal-advisor: Check for compliance and regulatory requirements
5. technical-writer: Ensure requirements are clearly documented and actionable

Focus on:
- Identifying missing requirements and assumptions
- Clarifying ambiguous or vague statements  
- Ensuring testable acceptance criteria
- Validating business value and user needs
- Flagging potential technical constraints
- Suggesting MVP scope refinements
- Applying dependency-aware planning (build foundational features first)

Provide output as:
- Analysis summary with key findings
- Gap identification with specific missing elements
- Enhanced requirements with acceptance criteria
- Recommended build order (dependencies first)
- Next steps and priorities
